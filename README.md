**Gavel** is an adaptive sanctioning enforcement framework based on the conceptual sanctioning process model introduced by Nardin et al. (2016). It enables agents to decide for the most appropriate sanctions to apply depending on their current context assessed by a set of sanctioning decision
factors.

The main advantages for using Gavel are its flexibility and adaptability. Gavel can be treated as a component which can be connected to or implemented within any agent. By using it, agents are free to choose the sanctions and intensity they deem the best to sanction a violator or complier agent. They may also update the system's legislation to obtain higher levels of norm compliance. As these decisions are all dependent on the current context and historical facts, Gavel can, therefore, assure high level of flexibility and adaptability for norm enforcement in Normative Multiagent Systems.
